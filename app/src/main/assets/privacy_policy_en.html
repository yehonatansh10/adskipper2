<h1>Privacy Policy - AdSkipper</h1>
<div class="date">Last updated: March 19, 2025</div>

<p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This policy explains how the "AdSkipper" application collects, uses, and protects your information.</p>

<h2>Information Collected by the App</h2>
<p>The application <strong>does not collect any personally identifiable information</strong>. We only collect anonymous information for service improvement:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Anonymous usage statistics (number of ads detected, applications where the app is active)</li>
    <li>Error data and crash reports (without personal information)</li>
    <li>Technical information about the device (OS version, device model) without unique identifiers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use and Storage of Information</h2>
<p>All collected information is stored <strong>exclusively on your device</strong> and is not shared with external servers or third parties. The data is used only for improving the application and solving errors.</p>

<h2>Required Permissions</h2>
<p>The application requests certain permissions to provide its service. Each permission is used only for the specific purposes described below:</p>

<h3>Accessibility Services</h3>
<p>This permission is the core of AdSkipper's functionality. It allows the app to detect when ads appear on your screen, identify specific ad elements, and perform automated actions to skip past ads. Without this permission, the app cannot detect or skip ads automatically. We strictly limit our use of this permission to the ad detection and skipping functions only. We do not collect, store, or transmit any screen content, and all processing happens locally on your device.</p>

<h3>Display Over Other Apps</h3>
<p>Required to draw interface elements on top of other apps and perform skip actions while you're using social media apps. This permission is only used when an ad is detected and needs to be skipped, allowing AdSkipper to perform the automated scrolling or tapping actions needed to bypass ads.</p>

<h3>Foreground Service</h3>
<p>Allows the app to run in the background while you use other apps, continuing to monitor for ads even when AdSkipper is not in focus. This permission is essential for the app to function properly, as it needs to be active while you're using social media apps where ads appear.</p>

<h3>Notification</h3>
<p>Enables displaying a persistent notification when the service is active, providing quick controls to pause or resume the service. Android requires apps with foreground services to display a notification so you know they're running. This notification also helps you quickly control the app's status.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>We take reasonable technical measures to protect the information stored on your device. Sensitive information in the application is encrypted using advanced encryption methods.</p>

<h2>Use of Third-Party Applications</h2>
<p>The application operates with other applications on your device, such as social media applications. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of these applications and we recommend that you review their privacy policies.</p>

<h2>User Rights</h2>
<p>You may at any time:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Delete all data stored by the application (through the application settings)</li>
    <li>Stop using the application and remove it</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. In case of material changes, we will notify you through the application.</p>

<h2>Contact Us</h2>
<p>For questions or clarifications regarding our privacy policy, you can contact us via email: adskipper2@gmail.com</p>
